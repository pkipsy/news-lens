### Filtering out Political Bias in American News Media

Today is a time of increasing political and cultural polarization in the United States. Our media reflects this polarization, with right and left-leaning outlets providing substantively different takes on the same breaking news.

The bipartisan organization [All Sides](http://allsides.com/) looks to provide a more balanced approach to news coverage by rounding up the top headlines of the day and showcasing reporting of these stories by outlets on the left, right, and center. This expert curation is invaluable to the continued health of our democracy.

[NewsLens](http://www.news-lens.online) takes that kernel of insight and scales it, so that *any* news story or blog post can be approached from all sides. Input a link to a breaking story, and NewsLens will recommend related articles that offer divergent perspectives and identify points of common ground in reporting across the political divide.
