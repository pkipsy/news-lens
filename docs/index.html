    <p>This visualization uses the open source Python library, <a href=https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext>Scattertext</a>, to illustrate differences between left and right-leaning media. It identifies key topics that are characteristic of both sides, as well as topics that are used more frequently by one side or the other. These differences are visible for both very common words (like <i>Donald Trump</i>) and rarer words (like <i>CBO</i>).</p>

    <p>The data for this visualization is drawn from two-years of headlines scraped from the bipartisan organization <a href="https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news">All Sides Media</a>. All Sides looks to provide a more balanced approach to news coverage by rounding up the top headlines of the day and showcasing reporting of these stories by outlets on the left, right, and center.</p>

    <p>The headline crawl yielded more than <b>3,000</b> articles, from over 100 of the most influential media organizations in the US today, including the BBC, Fox News, and the New York Times. </p>

        <p>You can open this visualization in a new tab by clicking <a href="https://pkipsy.github.io/news-lens/AllSides_Scattertext_RankDefault.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>This next set of visualizations relies on the open source Python library, <a href=https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis>PyLDAviz</a>, for interactive topic model visualization. </p>

    <p>Each visualization makes it possible to explore twenty different latent topics in these texts, along with their most highly associated words. The topics are ordered by their importance. <br><br>There is a lot to uncover! The <a href="https://pkipsy.github.io/news-lens/LDA-left_viz.html#topic=3&lambda=1&term=">Russia investigation</a>, <a href="https://pkipsy.github.io/news-lens/LDA-left_viz.html#topic=6&lambda=1&term=">school shootings</a>, and <a href="https://pkipsy.github.io/news-lens/LDA-right_viz.html#topic=5&lambda=1&term=">terrorism</a>, are just a few of the topics that vary in their coverage across party lines.</p>

        <p>Separate models and visualizations have been created for <a href="https://pkipsy.github.io/news-lens/LDA-left_viz.html">left</a>, <a href="https://pkipsy.github.io/news-lens/LDA-right_viz.html">right</a>, and <a href="https://pkipsy.github.io/news-lens/LDA-center_viz.html">center</a>-leaning media articles, from the All Sides headline crawl.
