### [Model Comparison](https://github.com/pkipsy/news-lens/blob/master/Exploratory-Analysis/Model-Comparison.ipynb)* 
Compares classification performance of a variety of learning algorithms (e.g., SVC, Bernoulli, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and word embeddings) and text transformations (bag of words vs TF-IDF). * 

Computationally intensive. Run on Google Cloud's [Data Lab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/) or Amazon's [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).
